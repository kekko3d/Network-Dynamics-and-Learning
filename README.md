# ***Network Dynamics and Learning***

This repository contains all the assignments from the course **[Network Dynamics and Learning](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TXLSM&p_a_acc=2021&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N)**. 

The course aims at presenting the mathematical foundations of networks with special emphasis on dynamical models both of deterministic and stochastic nature,
as well to illustrate their main engineering applications. The course covers the basics of: graph theory, non-negative matrices, Markov probabilistic models,
game theory, distributed optimization. It introduces the student to several applications: distributed optimization and inference algorithms, opinion dynamics,
epidemics models, learning in games.


Course Topics:

●  Topological and algebraic graph theory
●  Distributed averaging and linear flow dynamics
●  Distributed optimization
●  Markov chains
●  Contagion and diffusion over networks
●  Game theory and learning
●  Probabilistic graphical models
●  Random graphs

Technologies adopted: `NetworkX`, `Scikit-learn`
